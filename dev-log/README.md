# Dev Logs

This directory contains development logs for the boop project and is a reflection/post-mortem on the
development of select features and the project as a whole. This, notably, is _not_ a decision log or
justification for feature choices or implementation details. This should be read more as a journal or
blog post and is simply for the author's own reflection and learning or for the curious to peruse.
