__boop__

A disorganized collection of utils (currently just the one, but more soon, probably) that I personally
use while working with Zig. You may or may not find utils that are useful for you, as the intended audience
is me.


## Utilities

See [examples folder](https://github.com/JohnMurray/boop.zig/blob/main/examples) for working examples.

- [__`cli`__][cli] - Module containing a bare-bones CLI parser in the style of Go's `flags` package


  [cli]: https://github.com/JohnMurray/boop.zig/blob/main/src/cli.zig

## Contributing

Pretty sure this repo will only ever see contributions from myself, but if you feel so inclined pull
requests are welcome. It might take me a while to see it and/or respond, so set expectations low.
